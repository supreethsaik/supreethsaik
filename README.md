## Hi there 👋

I'm Supreeth, a newbie data scientist/front-end design engineer ... well I'm trying and learning everyday 🫣

I love seeing cool designs, projects, and porfolios, as a kid I've been pretty artistic but I lost it on the way, so NOW I'm trynna use tech to bring it to life and showcase it day-by-day!

Outside of trying to learn the basics starting from basics of Python to all the way mastering Web design and ML, you'll find me in the gym, watching any and every kind of KDrama, Anime, and drawing and now getting into photography as well.

Fun Facts:
- I love a nice cup of cold coffee!⚡(I'm not falling for the matcha propoganda sorry)
- I probably haven't watched any of the Top Movies out there so pls don't ask me if I did...lol
- and CR7 is my goat 🐐
